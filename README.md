This repository is dedicated to documenting, storing, and progressing all projects completed by the Research and Development division of the Bengal Bots student organization at Lousiana State University. 

The repository is separated by year, and then further separated by project. Each project folder contains the final version of the code and several example sketches used in the final product.
